<h2>Activities I like wasting my time on</h2>
<p><h4>Valorant</h4>
<pre> A fps game I mostly game on. Ranging from eighteen agents I play Viper &lt;one of the agents&gt; you're on a team of five against another five<br/>where one team is attacking to place a spike on site and the other is defending to stop that from happening.</pre></p>
<p><h4>Music</h4>
<pre>To me, music has no boundaries. I listen to various types genres &lt;execpt some country music&gt;
A few genres I can list off are<br/>Alternative Rock<br/>Indie<br/>Classical<br/>Anti-pop</pre>
